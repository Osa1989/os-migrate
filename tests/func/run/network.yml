# FIXME: Find a way we can test the whole playbook rather than just
# the role. Either make sure we're not in a play here and use
# import_playbook, or spawn an ansible-playbook subprocess? The latter
# might be actually a more precise way to test the real end-user
# experience.

# TODO: once the module actually writes the file, we should read and
# verify it here.

Misc
----

* Naming conventions - [underscores over hyphens in
  Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/1128#issuecomment-454519526).

  * Github does not support underscores in organization URLs
    though. So we have repo named os-migrate/os-migrate, and inside we
    have os_migrate Ansible collection.

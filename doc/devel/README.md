* [Development environment setup](dev-env-setup.md) - Environment
  configuration to test your patches locally. Emphasizes use of
  containers to keep your workstation clean.

  * [Using non-containerized
    Vagrant](dev-env-vagrant-non-containerized.md) - The main
    developer docs talk about using containerized Vagrant, which
